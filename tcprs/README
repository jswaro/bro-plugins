=================================

TCPRS is TCP traffic analyzer that specializes in the detection
and classification of retransmission and network reordering events.

The following forms of events are available in the TCPRS analyzer:

    Dead connection detection
    TCP option detection
    Retransmission detection and classification
    Limited Transmit and Fast Recovery detection
    Network reordering detection and classification
    RTT and initial RTO measurements


Policy scripts included:
policy/protocols/tcp/tcp_analysis.bro

Base scripts included:
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_deadconn.bro
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_recovery.bro
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_reorderings.bro
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_options.bro
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_retransmissions.bro
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_rtt.bro
base/protocols/tcp/tcp_osfp.bro

To use the analyzer without the use of any of the provided scripts, you will
need to put the following line in a script:

> redef tcprs_enabled = T;

Included with the analyzer is a collection of 103 test cases that
are used for iterative design and refinement of the analyzer. Each
test case is used to verify a specific function of the analyzer or
general classification of events.
